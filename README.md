# Reality.eth subgraph (incomplete)

This is the subgraph for reality.eth. As of 2021-05-17, it is not yet completed or deployed.

It should be able to parse most templates correctly, but as we do not yet have a complete port of the sprintf-js library used by the dapp, we cannot guarantee the exact same handling of edge cases. We recommend that anywhere important, such as a page where you allow people to submit bonds, you do the template handling and formatting in JavaScript.
